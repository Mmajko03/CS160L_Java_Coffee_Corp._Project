# CS160L_Java_Coffee_Corp._Project
When run, the application will prompt the user to choose from several options, in which the user would be allowed to create a coffee order, update the order log, update the ingredient inventory, and exit the application. When creating the order, the user can select from a few different coffees and the user will also be given the choice to add customizations to these coffees. After the user is done creating their coffee, the user is then asked if they would want to finalize their order or to add another coffee to the order.

The application has several files/classes created and implemented in order for this procces to work.

Coffee Interface File --> This file allows all the other file that are implementing this class to use specific methods such as
getCost(), printCoffee(), and/or getIngredients().

BlackCoffee File --> This is a file that will allow the user to print a coffee called a black coffee. The user will also be able to print the cost and ingredients of the black coffee object.
